Description:
Point to a directory of an application you need to install and automatically and recursively make all files types of your choice executable. A little time saver utility I created and wished to share with the community.

NOTE: When choosing the directory you must give the full and correct path.
IMPORTANT: This is not full of error catching code yet, more will be added in the future, Use at your own risk.
